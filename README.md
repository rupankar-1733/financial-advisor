# AI-Powered Financial Advisor

## Overview
This project presents an **AI-powered financial advisor** designed to analyze stock market data and provide personalized investment and trading recommendations. The system integrates machine learning, technical analysis, natural language processing (NLP) for news sentiment, and macroeconomic data to offer holistic market insights and portfolio strategies.

## Features

### Data Processing & Analysis
- Historical and real-time stock price data ingestion and cleaning
- Calculation of key technical indicators: SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, momentum, and volume analysis
- Candlestick pattern recognition and signal generation with volume confirmation

### Machine Learning Models
- Multi-model price prediction using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and LSTM neural networks
- Robust time-series validation to avoid data leakage and ensure realistic performance
- Portfolio-level multi-stock analysis with parallelized data processing for scalability

### News Sentiment Integration
- Aggregates real-time financial news from multiple trusted sources (Economic Times, Bloomberg, Reuters, Moneycontrol, Business Standard)
- Market-specific keyword weighting and TextBlob-based sentiment analysis for accurate market mood detection
- Combines news sentiment with price predictions for enhanced trading signals

### Macro Economic Data Integration
- Fetches and analyzes key macroeconomic indicators (Nifty, Sensex, VIX, USD/INR, crude oil, US Treasury yields)
- Sector-wise sensitivity modelling to incorporate broader economic factors into stock predictions
- Stress testing of models against simulated market shocks and crises for reliability

### Automation & Deployment
- Automated live data fetching, scheduled analysis on market hours, and trading journal for tracking performance
- Modular, object-oriented codebase for easy extension and maintenance
- Future-ready architecture with plans for conversational AI chatbot using state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
